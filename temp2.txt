Question: Calculate the sum of squares from 1 to 10
Routed to: math
Answer: To calculate the sum of squares from 1 to 10, we need to find the square of each number from 1 to 10 and then add them all together.

1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2

= 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100

= 385

Therefore, the sum of squares from 1 to 10 is 385.

Question: Write a Python function to reverse a string
Routed to: coding
Answer: Here is a Python function that reverses a string:

```python
def reverse_string(input_string):
    return input_string[::-1]

# Example usage
input_string = "hello"
reversed_string = reverse_string(input_string)
print(reversed_string)  # Output: "olleh"
```

This function takes an input string and returns the reversed version of it using Python's slicing syntax.
